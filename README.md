# keybordvisualizer
A constant on-screen tool to learn a new keyboard/layout (Minidox).

This project has mainly been tested on Ubuntu - issues might occur on Windows and MacOS.

A QWERTY layout is assumed for this project, but can be (manually) changed by supplying your own key layout and putting it in the images folder - just make sure you keep the names matching.  A template picture (minidox.png) is supplied for helping to visualize your own layouts.

The locations of each key are hard-coded and are kept the same from default Minidox layouts, so key locations will have to be updated if new templates are used.

Not every key is easily read by the computer (ex. Fn modifier key), and is seen here with the "raise" and "lower" keys.
To see what each layer has, hold down the layer modifier(s) and then hit any key (top-left is usually the safest) to see what you can do in that layer.
