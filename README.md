# keybordvisualizer
A constant on-screen tool to learn a new keyboard/layout (Minidox)

This project has mainly been tested on Ubuntu - issues might occur on Windows and MacOS.

A QWERTY layout is assumed for this project, but can be (manually) changed by supplying your own key layout and putting it in the images folder - just make sure you keep the names matching.  A template picture (minidox.png) is supplied for helping to visualize your own layouts.

The locations of each key are hard-coded and are kept the same from default Minidox layouts, so key locations will have to be updated if new templates are used.
